This repository contains a variety of Python scripts that I use in my daily productivity workflows. Whether you're automating repetitive tasks, managing data, or just looking for ways to optimize your day-to-day operations, these scripts have you covered.

To get started with these scripts, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python website</a>.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. If any script requires specific libraries, they will be listed at the beginning of the script. You can install them using pip:

## 🛠️ Usage

Each script in this repository is designed to be self-contained and easy to use. You can run a script by navigating to its directory and executing it with Python:
